## Chat APP

Add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this
template. The goal is to build a React app that shows 2 chat windows for the
two existing users - Amy and John. The messages they send to each other should
appear in both chat windows. On Amy's screen, her messages should appear in green and
John's messages should appear in blue. On John's screen, his messages should appear in
green and Amy's messages should appear in blue.
