# My-React-Journey

so.. that's how began my journey to learn react.
and before to describe step-by-step in my journey
i have to apolozige for my english (i'm training this too haha)
that's all, let's go!

## Step 1 React Fundamentals :runner:

like my mummy aways say: 'we have to start from the beginning' and that's how i start.
before to start to code, i decide do go deep about the core concepts about React.js and
why ???

Tyler mcginnis says about fourth reasons why whe shoulde use react and they are:

### 1.Compositional model
   Composition occurrs when we join simple functions to contruct another function more complex. We can think a simple function    as a role that do one thing and that's what React do when we build a page combining various functions.
   
### 2. Declarative nature
   To talk about the advantage of the declarative nature, we have to talk about the imperative nature too. In a simple way, we    can say that the imperature nature is when we need to solve a problem and we need to say how to solve (step-by-step) to get
   the result and the declarative nature is when we just need what we want e let the responsability to discover the way to get    this with the tool, in this case, with React.
   
### 3. The way data flows through a Component
    

### 4. It's just JAVASCRIPT!!
