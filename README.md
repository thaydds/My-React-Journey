# My-React-Journey

So.. this is how my journey began to learn react.
Let's go!

## Step 1 React Fundamentals :runner:

like my mummy always say: 'we have to start from the beginning' and that's how i start.
before to start to code, i decide do go deep about the core concepts about React.js and
why ???

Tyler mcginnis says about fourth reasons why we should use react and they are:

### 1.Compositional model
   Composition occurrs when we join simple functions to contruct another function more complex. We can think a simple function    as a role that do one thing and that's what React do when we build a page combining various functions.
   
### 2. Declarative nature
   To talk about the advantage of the declarative nature, we have to talk about the imperative nature too. In a simple way, we    can say that the imperature nature is when we need to solve a problem and we need to say how to solve (step-by-step) to get
   the result and the declarative nature is when we just need what we want e let the responsability to discover the way to get    this with the tool, in this case, with React.
   
### 3. The way data flows through a Component

   This previous image say that the data flows unidirectional in the react ecosystem fro the parent to children. It's so          helpful to not get lost about the data uptdate in your app.
    
### 4. It's just JAVASCRIPT!!
   Learn react isn't about learn a library to build something, learn react is about improve your skills with javascript and be    prepared for incomming changes of the language.
   
Now we already know why use React, so it's important talk about some fundamentals concepts that envolve this library:

* UI render
* JSX
* Props
* State
* Components
* Stateless Components or Functional Components
* Controled Components
